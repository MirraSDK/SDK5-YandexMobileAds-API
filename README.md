If you publish on RuStore, make sure to mention your email that is used to create Yandex Mobile Ads account in the description of an app. For example, you can write something like: "Support: myemail@example.com".

You can't create Ad Unit Ids for RuStore if you don't have game already published on Google Play. But if you want to, you can contact support for further assistance - this might work.
